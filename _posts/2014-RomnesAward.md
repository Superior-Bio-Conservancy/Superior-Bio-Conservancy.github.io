This award, for professors within six years of tenure, is supported by the [Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation](http://www.warf.org/) (WARF). H.I. Romnes was the former president of the WARF Board of Trustees, and the award recognizes his service to the University through an unrestricted $50,000 research grant.
