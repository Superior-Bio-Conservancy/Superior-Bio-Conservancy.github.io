Congratulations to Megs Seeley for acceptance of her first paper, to the Journal of Biogeography!  In this paper, which was developed as Megs' undergraduate honors thesis, we assess the role of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation on American Beech (*Fagus grandifolia*) populations in Michigan and Wisconsin, using historical data from the Public Land Survey and a mixture of species distribution models.  Nice work and a good launch as Megs applies for grad school after a year working as an intern with NASA on air quality and remote sensing.
