We're delighted to hear that the Graham et al. [ 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/33/9310.abstract) PNAS paper received the PNAS Cozzarelli Prize! This award recognizes recently published PNAS papers of outstanding scientific excellence and originality, and Graham et al. was one of the six papers published in 2016 to earn this distinction.  Yue Wang and Jack Williams were co-authors on this paper.
