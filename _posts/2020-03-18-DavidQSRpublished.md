David's first paper, just published in [QSR](https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1alc4-4PRtymX), presents a new record of temperature and vegetation history in the southern Great Lakes region at the end of the last Ice Age.  The paper finds that the plant communities with no modern analog formed soon after temperatures began to rise, suggesting that warmer climates likely were a contributing factor.  Other factors, such as high temperature seasonality and the declines of megafaunal megaherbivores, remain in the mix!  Davidâ€™s paper is also notable as one of the first in the region to use the brGDGT biomarkers as a signal of past temperatures, for finding that temperature variations were not as pronounced as reported in [Watson et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.12.011), and for a careful analysis of uncertainties in brGDGT-based temperature reconstructions.  Well done David; the first of many!
