Kevin Burke has a new paper out, published this week in [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/52/13288). As part of his dissertation, Kevin quantifies the similarity of projected future climate states to six geohistorical periods including the mid-Pliocene and early Eocene. This work suggests that under a [high emissions scenario](../data/Median_Analog_Animation_RCP85.gif) (RCP 8.5), future climates may resemble the Pliocene by 2030, and the Eocene by 2150.
