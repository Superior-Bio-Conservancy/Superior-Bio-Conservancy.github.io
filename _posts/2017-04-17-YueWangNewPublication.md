Yue Wang has  published a new paper *"The southern coastal Beringian land bridge: cryptic refugium or pseudorefugium for woody plants during the Last Glacial Maximum?"* in [Journal of Biogeography](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.13010/full).  This paper presents strong evidence that the southern coastal Bering Land Bridge was not a refugium for woody plants during the last glacial maximum, and that the St. Paul mammoth populations persisted on an open tundra vegetation for thousands of years.
