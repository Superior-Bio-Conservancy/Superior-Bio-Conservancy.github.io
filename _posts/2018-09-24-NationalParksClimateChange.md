In a new paper in [Environmental Research Letters](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aade09/meta), we show that the US National Park System has experienced about twice the warming as the rest of US over the past century, and more drying too.  Even under lower-emission future scenarios (i.e. RCP2.6), 58% of the US National Park System is projected to experience a 2C warming over the coming century, but switching from high-emission to low-emission scenarios would reduce the projected temperature increases by one-half to two-thirds. This work was led by Patrick Gonzalez at UC-Berkeley with key work carried out at UW-Madison's Center for Climatic Research.
