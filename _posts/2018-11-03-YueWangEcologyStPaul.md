Yue Wang has a new paper out in [Ecology](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2524), from her dissertation, in which she uses Niche Mapper to simulate the carrying capacity of woolly mammoths on St. Paul Island, Alaska.  This work also tests hypotheses about freshwater limitation and forage limitation and points to a previously unrecognized population bottleneck during the Younger Dryas.
