In a [new paper](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1826/20152817) published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Kaitlin Maguire and coauthors use fossil data from the last deglaciation to show that CLMs have higher predictive skill than SDMs when predicting to communities and climates with no modern analog.  Both CLMs and SDMs suffer reduced predictive skill but the decrease is lessened for CLMs.  These results suggest that CLMs may be more robust when predicting species and biodiversity responses to the novel climates of the 21st century
