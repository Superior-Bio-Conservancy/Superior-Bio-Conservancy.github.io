                <p>The Superior Bio-Conservancy is an ambitious plan to protect and restore the biological integrity and hydrology of the Lake Superior watershed and the Laurentian Forest Province. This Bio-region in the Western Great Lakes includes parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Ontario. The conservation plan will create maps and effectively advocate for the creation of protected wildlife corridors to connect large tracts of public (Federal, State and County forests) land to avoid fragmentation. This landscape has unique Tribal ceded usfructuary rights that are sovereign and serve as a form of conservation easement on all public lands.  This plan will utilize those covenants to aid in establishing the Superior Bio-Conservancy..</p>
